        <p>
            Steam Overload is a utility to allow you to keep track of which games you have completed in your Steam library; particularly after the mayhem that is the Steam sales. In essence, it is a glorified check list, but one that can help save you some time when keeping track of your game list.

        <h2 class="lead">Do you store any of my personal information?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>No</strong>, when you use the "Sign in with Steam" button, you are authenticating yourself with <strong>Steam</strong> and then Steam simply informs the website of the user who signed in. No personal information is stored at all, other than information on which games you have marked as completed, of course.
